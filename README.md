# InstaSlam

## Project specs:

Instagram Clone (a.k.a. Photo Gallery Web Page)
Create a basic photo gallery web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

Central feature: when a user clicks a thumbnail image, that image shows up as the main image.

Some additional enhancements:

1. dynamically create the thumbnails from an array of image URLs
2. modify the main image container to show some meta-data (perhaps with this layout)
3. swap out the meta-data information each time you click a different thumbnail
4. add arrow buttons on either side of the main image to go to the next and previous images.
